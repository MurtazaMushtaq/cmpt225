I used the heap.h file given by the professor in assignment 3 and just changed all the < than signs in trickle up and trickle down in order to make the heap a max heap. As the values will be inputted in the heap, the heap will be arranged in such a order that all the elements are in descending order. I created two heaps h1 and h2 and then read data from the text file. All the values before a 0 is reached are inputted in h1 and after 0 is reached all values inputted in h2. the priority for each value is the value itself. For example, if value 5 is beiing entered in h1, the value and priority will both be 5 when it is inputted. I didn't download or use any code, library or information from the internet. I only modified the a4.cpp file given to us by the prof and linked the heap.h file from assignment 3 which again was given by the prof.
